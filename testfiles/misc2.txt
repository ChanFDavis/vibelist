Hello, user

Welcome to my webapp, codenamed VIBEY. The purpose of this program is to take some kind of text input and form a Spotify playlist based off of it. Here are the steps it takes.

1. Prompts user for a form of text input.
	- As of writing, only .txt files are allowed.
2. Parse through the text and pick out keywords
	- These are planned to be anything but 'neutral' keywords such as: 'a', 'is', 'the', 'are', etc.
3. Each word correlates to a certain number of attributes and there is a scale to how much of the attribute is given by the word.
	- This is still being decided, but I think that the general form follows this example:
	-	'depressing'= happiness -2, anger +0, confusion +1
4. After reading the file, the app will create a vibe profile by adding up all the attribute values of the words in the document.
5. Using the vibe profile, the app will create a Spotify playlist with a given number of songs that are:
	a. Already saved in the user's library
	b. Correspond to the vibe of the vibe profile
6. The app then saves this playlist to the user's library with the following info:
	- Name: "Vibe Playlist" + the date/time it was created
	- Description: a link to the app, the vibe profile, other information
